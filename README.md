# Text Based Game

This is a text based game inspired by Zork.

The game is played by typing commands into the terminal.


## Trying it out

Start the game by running `main.py`.

Here are valid commands:
- `look around`
- `go to <location>`
- `gather <item>`
- `inventory`
- `combine item1 with/and item2`
- `eat/drink/consume item`
- `drop (all) item`

#### Where can I go?
Currently there are only two locations:
`beach` and `forest`

#### What can I gather/collect?
Each location has different items you can gather.
Travel there to find them.
Some items require you to have something before you can collect them.

*Take a peek in the `config.py` to see which locations have what.*

### What can I combine to make?
The idea here is to experiement with combinations.
As of now the game is limited to only 4 recipes.

*Take a peek in the `config.py` to see the valid combinations.*
